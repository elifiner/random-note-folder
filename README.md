# Random Note++

Random Folder Note is a plugin for Obisidian.md that replicates the built-in Random note, but adds the ability to select a random file in a specified folder.

## Features

This plugin allows setting up 3 distinct random commands for 3 different folders.

For example:

 - a random project from projects `projects/`
 - a random notes for a book from `books/`
 - a random permanent note from `notes/`

You can call this plugin via commands or via ribbon icons.

See DEVELOPING.md in this repo for instructions on how to install this plugin manually.
